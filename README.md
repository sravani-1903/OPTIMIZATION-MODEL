This production planning optimization project demonstrates a comprehensive linear programming solution to a realistic business problem faced by ACME Manufacturing Company which produces three distinct products namely Widgets Gadgets and Thingamajigs each with different profit margins and resource requirements where the company must determine the optimal production mix to maximize monthly profit while operating under strict constraints including limited machine hours of 1000 per month labor hours of 800 per month raw material A availability of 1200 units per month raw material B availability of 900 units per month and market demand limits for each product with Widgets having a maximum demand of 200 units Gadgets 300 units and Thingamajigs 150 units where each product requires different amounts of these constrained resources with Widgets needing 2 machine hours 1 labor hour 3 units of material A and 1 unit of material B per unit produced while generating 40 dollars profit per unit whereas Gadgets require 1.5 machine hours 2 labor hours 2 units of material A and 3 units of material B per unit while providing 30 dollars profit per unit and Thingamajigs demand 3 machine hours 1.5 labor hours 4 units of material A and 2 units of material B per unit but offer the highest profit margin at 50 dollars per unit making this a complex multi constraint optimization problem that the project solves using Python PuLP library for linear programming implementation with integer decision variables representing production quantities for each product where the objective function maximizes total profit as the sum of profit per unit multiplied by production quantities subject to resource availability constraints demand limit constraints and non negativity constraints resulting in an optimal solution that determines exact production quantities for each product calculates maximum achievable profit identifies resource utilization percentages and slack values analyzes binding versus non binding constraints to reveal bottlenecks performs sensitivity analysis to understand which resources are most constraining provides comprehensive visualizations including production mix charts profit contribution pie charts resource utilization bar graphs and production versus demand comparisons while delivering actionable business insights such as identifying the most profitable product mix recommending capacity increases for bottleneck resources suggesting strategic focus areas and proposing what if scenarios for further analysis with the entire solution validated through constraint verification to ensure feasibility and the model extended with scenario analysis capabilities demonstrating how changes in resource availability would impact optimal solutions making this a complete end to end optimization framework that can be adapted for various manufacturing supply chain finance marketing and operations research applications where resource allocation decisions must be optimized under multiple competing constraints while maximizing business objectives.
